## **Motivation**

#### As part of global affairs of student government, we are trying how to improve global student’s life in Handong. One of our business, we translate all of words that uses in handong. And we are hesitated how to open these data to global students. First of all, we think about share in google docs, pdf file, upload in hisnet or smart campus app. But this things have problems that we have to update every modification. Then, as I heard about this project I figure it out that I can make simple webpage. This is not perfect and fancy, I did this project to help someone.

## **Necessity**

#### Handong representatives of 53 countries. Communities are composed based on regional and cultural background so that we have several communities, such as Africa, China, Japan, Indonesia, Latin, Europe, America, Malaysia, Mongol, Thailand, and other countries. Their uniqueness are preserved and respected. But they are in Korea, most of them have to be used to Korean culture which is part of handong. There will be lots of unfamiliar words and culture. So we are tried to briefly explain why do Koreans called like this. They can search whenever they want if they have some question or curiosity.

### **Contents**

1. Campus Building
2. Shortened words
3. Handong Culture
4. Spirituality

### **Benefit**

#### By making this simple website, I believe we can apply this for many ways like we can link this webpage to smart campus app, we can make app separately by using these data, mananging efficiently. Plus we can put some functions that users can search words directly and add some words or explanation. I hope this project can be helpful for global stuent’s life better.
